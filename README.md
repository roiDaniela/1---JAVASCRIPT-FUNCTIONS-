# 1---JAVASCRIPT-FUNCTIONS-

<b>INDIVIDUAL EXERCISE 1</b>
<br/>
Write a function called calcAge in such a way that when the code below executes, age is 28.
<br/>
<code>var age = calcAge(2017, 1989)</code>
<br/>
<br/>

<b>INDIVIDUAL EXERCISE 2</b>
<br/>
Change the function above so that it:
<br/>

calculates the 2 possible ages based on the years provided. For example a person born in 2013 may be either 3 or 4 years old at the moment!
outputs the result to the screen like so: "You are either NN or NN"
<br/>
bonus: instead of passing in the current year as an argument, find a way to get it automatically with JavaScript.
<br/>
<br/>

<b>INDIVIDUAL EXERCISE 3</b>
<br/>
Write a JavaScript function called isPrime that accepts a number as a parameter and checks if the number is prime or not. Return true if it is prime or false if it is not prime. Don't Google this one ;)
<br/>
Note: A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself (for example, 3 is prime as the number 2 does not divide into it , 4 is not prime as 2 does divide into it, similarly 9 is not prime as 3 divides into it). To make sure you understand, is 13 prime?
<br/><br/>

<b>INDIVIDUAL EXERCISE 4</b>
<br/>
Write a JavaScript function that accepts an array of integers as a parameter and returns the average of all its items.
<br/><br/>

<b>INDIVIDUAL EXERCISE 5</b>
Write a JavaScript function that accepts two parameters: one being an array of integers, and the other being a number. The function should return true or false depending on whether the number exists in the array.

<b>INDIVIDUAL EXERCISE 6</b>
Write a C++ function (just kidding, use JavaScript) that accepts two parameters: one being an array of integers, and the other being a number. The function should print all the numbers from the array that are smaller than the number that was passed in.
